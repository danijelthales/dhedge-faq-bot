      "value": " Traders can execute a transaction by selecting an input asset, an output asset and an amount. The trading fee depends on the currency traded into. Crucially, there is no slippage. The spot price for 1 sETH is the same as for 100 sETH.\n\nThe Exchange interface allows the trader to choose from a range of transaction speeds. Beyond speed of transaction confirmation, selecting a slower or faster gas value won't affect the trade itself. However, if the network is highly congested, the trade may fail if the token is no longer available at the same price."
