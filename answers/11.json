      "value": "You can be invested in a dHEDGE pool in 5 minutes or less. Whether you are a whitelisted private pool investor or you are participating in a public pool you will first need to make sure you have sUSD, the native stablecoin to the Synthetix protocol. Curve.Fi has a deep pool of liquidity for swapping your USDC, USDT or DAI into sUSD. From here all that is required is to find the pool you wish to participate in and swap your sUSD for pool tokens. Also please ensure that your Web 3 wallet is connected when swapping for pool tokens."
