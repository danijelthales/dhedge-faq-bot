      "value": "There are some limitations to transferring the SNX tokens in your wallet. You can't transfer:\n\n1. staked tokens: the SNX that collateralize your debt up to 750%\n2. escrowed tokens: SNX rewards remain locked under escrow for a year after distribution"
    },

      "title": "Burning sUSD",
      "value": "To unlock staked tokens, press Burn on [Mintr](https://mintr.synthetix.io/). Press View transferable SNX. Here you'll be able to gauge how much SNX you can unlock for burning a given amount of sUSD. You'll need to burn enough sUSD to unlock at least the number of escrowed rewards tokens you have, before you'll be able to access transferable SNX."

      "title": "Fee Reclamation",
      "value": "Additionally, the team has implemented a trading solution called Fee Reclamation to prevent frontrunners from taking advantage of latent price oracles. The consequence is that you may not be able to transfer or transact with a synth for several minutes following your recent transaction as the oracle confirms its most recent price."
