      "value": "Managers may charge a performance fee and/or management fees as an incentive to share their trading strategies with the wider market or their whitelisted partners. One industry benchmark is for managers to capture a 2% fee on total assets under management (the management fee) and 20% fee on newly generated profits (the performance fee). \n\nWith the dHEDGE protocol, managers also have an incentive to offer competitive fee structures as they will be competing against algorithmic strategies and other traders to manage a larger size of assets -- and their performance can be scrutinized in real-time.\n"

      "value": "There is an admin fee, which is 10% of the managers performance fee.  This fee is collected in pool tokens which are allocated to the Uber pool.  The Uber pool is governed by DHT stakers. \n\ndHEDGE pools will never incur slippage costs on individual trades as a byproduct of trading with Synthetixâ€™s infinite liquidity synthetic asset protocol, which is another way dHEDGE sets itself apart as the leading software system in the decentralised asset management industry.\n"
