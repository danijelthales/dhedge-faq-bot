      "value": "You can start your trading pool in less than five minutes. On [site](https://app.dhedge.org/), you can create a pool by connecting your Web 3 wallet, entering the details about your fund including the pool name and manager name, stocking the pool with an initial set of your own capital, and making a few approvals in your Web 3 wallet. The total cost of standing up a pool are the gas costs required for interacting with the dHedge smart contracts."
