      "value": "The team has a [good explanation](https://blog.synthetix.io/inverse-synths-are-back/#how-inverse-synths-work-) of how inverse synths work. Synths trade in a range with an upper and lower limit and, if limits are breached by the real-world asset, the synth is disabled and the positions are liquidated. At some point after, the team will deploy a new version of the inverse synth with new upper and lower bounds."
