      "value": "This is how vDHT works:\n\nvDHT is based on staked DHT * lock-up time\nvDHT decays linearly over time\nFor example, a user locking-up DHT for 10 months instead of 1 month will have 10 times as many vDHT\nUser can increase amount of DHT locked at any time as well as increase the lock-up time\n\nvDHT declines linearly as lockup time goes to zero. Your governance and earnings power is calculated as vDHT/(Total vDHT).
